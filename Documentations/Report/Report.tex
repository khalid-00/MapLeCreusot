%<<<<<<< HEAD
\section{Goal of the Project}
The goal of this project is to develop a software to locate (and rate) various buildings, such as schools, university buildings, major offices, hospitals, various shops, cool restaurants, streets, roads, parks, and other interesting points in Le-Creusot.
The key idea is to develop a software to visualize Le-Creusot, its streets, some
buildings, roads, and parks, in which the user can perform several actions, such as asking for an itinerary between two (or passing through more) points.
%=============================================================
\section{Completeness of the Project}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Place Locating}
Twenty locations were provided on this project, and there is ability to add many other places due to requirements, but user can't add places, only programmer.
User's privilege on this stage of the project is limited to chose only from a list of those twenty places.
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Place Rating}
This Feature isn't added yet, but it maybe available in next releases.
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Routing}
Routing in this stage only by foot, expanding travel Methods to car, bicycle, and Train is possible in the following releases. 
%=============================================================
%\section{Dependencies}
%Apart from STL, I’m using Boost Graph Library (BGL), which in turn depends on other Boost libraries, which in turn depends on other Boost libraries, so I included the whole Boost libraries at once.

\section{Overview of the Project}

% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item The first item
% 	\item The second item
% 	\item The third etc 
% \end{enumerate}

The goal of this project is to develop a software to show the whole picture of Le Creusot city. Apart from that, it also locates various amenities, such as schools, university buildings, major offices, hospitals, various shops, cool restaurants, streets, roads, parks, and other interesting points in Le-Creusot. With this map, user can search, rate and comment for the places of interests and do routing to get there. I the follow section, a more clear picture of the goals and achievements of this picture will be shown. \\

This project would be a great opportunity for us to practice and get a little bit more familiar with the C++. Besides, it's also a chance for us to project management. This two parts of contents will also be explain in the following.



\section{Dataset Introduction}

In this project, we decide to use OSM(open-street-map) data as the base data. OSM data provides huge amount of detailed but abstract details for users. We choose this data-set because the following advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It provide detailed data base on nodes, ways and relations. Which will be more convenient to implement the Dijkstra's algorithms for routing.
	\item With the standard format of database, this application can be applicable for other cities or even countries out of box.
	\item It is a little bit more complicated, which will help us get more practice.
\end{enumerate}

Of course, choosing this way to develop the application means more complexity, more time consuming and more difficult to manage the project. But we still go for it because no pay no gain :D

%=============================================================
\section{Data Manipulation}
\subsection{Overview}
This part of code aims to handle the OSM data. We use {\textit{Libosmium}} {\cite{Libosmium}} to load the file and apply basic filtering to the raw data with the code in {\textbf{modelDataHandler.h}}. That is basically a modification from the example of the library. After that, all the data will be loaded on heap using {\textit{std::map}} in the {\textbf{modelData.h}}. The file {\textbf{modelDataStructure.h}} defines the basic type of the OSM element. And {\textbf{model.h}} is the top level package of all the information we read from the file and provide interface for other part of the code to access those data. In the following subsections, I will give detailed explanations for some of those code.

\subsection{ModelData Class}

This class actually contains all available information we get from the OSM file. It is basically a container for several std::map for different kind of data( nodes, ways, relations, etc.) and other supported std::map for place searching. The reason why we load all file in the heap using map is that the interface to access data in {\textit{Libosmium}} is not so convenient. By using the std::map, we can easily access all available with the id of the data. Although it has a drawback that when we load a large file, it would takes a large mount of ram. But since we are now only focus on the city level map, this is not an issue. It also declares to friend {\textbf{modelDataHandler}} so that the OSM file data can be written in the private member of {\textbf{ModelData}}. And the handler will only be called when we load a new file, which ensures the raw data will not be modified again when the loading is finished.


\subsection{ModelDataHandler Class}

This class is modified from an example of {\textit{Libosmium}}. It is responsible for extracting data from OSM file while filtering different types of roads and buildings. This class will only be called when the user load a new file.

%=============================================================
\section{Algorithm and Routing}

This part of code organized in three different classes, each of them contains header, and source File:
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{ MyGraphBuilder Class:}
This class mainly handles data provided from our data structure represented by the Model which depends on the OSM file in its compressed format PBF.
This class mainly takes the nodes included inside ways only from the
Model as an input, then builds vertices and edges between vertices to construct the graph, which in turn will be as an input to the next stage which is nothing except Dijkstra algorithm.
The graph in my approach is \textbf{adjacency list }proposed by Boost Graph Library.
The need for this procedure comes from the fact that: finding shortest path will be implemented through an algorithm, and the algorithm deals with a graph, not a map, so I wrote this class to build the desired graph from the data structure we imported from OSM file.
The input for this class is the Model (data structure) extracted from OSM file, 
and the output is a bidirectional weighted graph.
bidirectional: because it’s easy to implement, in case we want improve it to directional graph, we must do a complicated constrains, and check each tag, to see the type of transportation, and if the way was one direction, or bidirectional.
Weighted graph: because we are calculating Euclidean distance between the nodes depending on longitude, and latitude.
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{ MyAlgorithm Class:}
This class takes the graph produced on the past class MyGraphBuilder, and the source node which we will start from, and runs Dijkstra algorithm proposed by Boost Graph Library to Find the shortest path between the source node, and all other nodes in The graph.
Special function in this class called: getShortPath takes the destination node, then returns the shortest path between the source and destination only.
In case that there was no path between nodes, the path (vector) will contain only one default node, so we don’t face issues due to empty vector.
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{ ShortPath Class:}
This class is just to reduce amount of code in the main window, it doesn’t do much, it just takes source node, destination node, and Model, then it builds the graph from the Model using MyGraphBuilder class, and runs MyAlgorithm class, and its special function getShortPath, finally the output is our shortest path.

%============================================================
\section{Routing}
Routing on this approach is just on foot, it’s possible to add more transport methods later using tag filtering, building different transport maps, vertices, and edges, but unfortunately time was short for this project ! .
\\Isolated nodes which doesn’t belong to any way are not included in building the Graph, because our purpose is to find a way between two nodes, so I didn’t build the graph with all nodes, only connected nodes which belong to way.
Euclidean distance between the nodes is our way to assign weight to edges between nodes, and of course the way or path is nothing except group of sequential edges between connected nodes.
%>>>>>>> dev
%============================================================
\section{GUI}
%------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Overview}

The GUI is composed by two part of the code. One uses a class promoted from {\textbf{QGraphicsView}} for displaying the map and interact with the users. The other one is for menu bars and routing selection as a complementary interaction entry. The interaction allowed with the user is managed by a {\textit{Finite State Machine}} in the class {\textbf{MapView}}. Those details will be well explained in the following of the report.

\subsection{Rendering}

\subsubsection{MapView}



\subsubsection{SceneBuilder}



\subsubsection{RenderItem}



\subsection{Widget}
Running the program that will show a window with a Menu and four buttons source, destination, navigate, and cancel.
%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{GUI_NoMap.JPG}
%\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,natwidth=1200,natheight=700]{GUI_NoMap.JPG}
\end{center}
%------------------------------------------------------------
To start working, you should select (Menu - Open )
to open the map file, which should be with (.pbf) extension.
After you select your map, the software loads the map file showing the map.
%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{GUI_Map0.JPG}
%\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,natwidth=1200,natheight=700]{GUI_Map0.JPG}
\end{center}
%------------------------------------------------------------
The Drop-down lists source, and destination contains 20 places for each of them, all on Le Creusot city, where you can select your start point, and destination.
%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{GUI_Map1.JPG}
%\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,natwidth=1200,natheight=700]{GUI_Map1.JPG}
\end{center}
%------------------------------------------------------------
by clicking on navigate button, the shortest path will be drawn by red , so you can see the way you should follow.
%------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{GUI_Map2.JPG}
%\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth,natwidth=1200,natheight=700]{GUI_Map2.JPG}
\end{center}
%------------------------------------------------------------
Cancel button is to hide that path, and you can choose again your start point and target, so your path again will be drawn for you.
To finish, you can select (Menu - Quit) to exit the software.
%=============================================================
\section{Difficulties during implementation:}
There is two kind of Difficulties here:
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Difficulties we got rid of it:} 
%*************************************************************
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textbf{First difficulty was CMake didn’t find some libraries:}}\\
specially Boost Library, later we used qmake.
\item {\textbf{Second difficulty was that edges can’t be built using idType nodes:}\\
the solution for that was mapping the idType Nodes to unsigned int indexes through a map, so each node has ID, and vertex number.}
\item{\textbf{Third one is redundancy of nodes in different Ways:}\\
the solution was to compare each node of way to the map we built as solution to
problem1.2, so if the node already found, we don’t add it to our map, instead we just call it and get node index.}	
\end{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Difficulties we can solve, but it needs more time:}
%*************************************************************
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textbf{Supporting different travel method.}}
\item {\textbf{Building directional graph instead of bidirectional one.}}
\item {\textbf{Adding reviews, and stars options to the GUI.}}
\item {\textbf{Adding locations on the map.}}
\end{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Unexpected Difficulties}
Losing member of the team at critical time of the project doubled the responsibilities to do more than what we have already planned to do, and forced us to work under pressure in some parts of the project which we didn't have ideas about it before enough time.
%=============================================================
\chapter{Project Management}
%=============================================================
\section{Overview of the Project Planning}
%<<<<<<< HEAD
%We Received the Project on 30Th of September,it took us about 2 weeks to team up in a group of 3 students, then we started The Research for the Project since 15Th of October, Research for this project took 3 weeks until 6Th of November, There was many choices, and due to strict conditions such as: the Project should work under different operating systems, we excluded promising solutions such as "Libsmscout" which was easy to use Library with advanced features, but it doesn't work on Windows, only Linux, that lead us to more complicated choices such as "Libosmium" and "Boost" Libraries.

%>>>>>>> dev
The Implementation started on the 6Th of November, each student worked on different part of the project: "Data Manipulation and Map Rendering" for Deng, "Shortest Path Algorithm" for Belal, and "Graphical User Interface" for Our Third Partner.
Ten Days later At 16Th of November Deng Proposed Three Solutions for dealing with the Project:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\textbf{ First solution: Using one-for-all library.}}
\item{\textbf{Second solution: Using OSM data access library.}}
\item{\textbf{Third solution: Display the map using Image.}}
\end{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------------------------
At that Point Belal and Deng Agreed on the second solution, because we want to propose something different and more advanced than image solution.
Our partner preferred to go on different direction with third solution, so we had to work on the project as a team of two members only !.
Following the advice to "Expect what is Unexpected " we reduced the project size and features so we can finish it before deadline.
A week later, on 24Th of November we had our first working project with minimum features available, a week later on the 1st of December We did a simple GUI to deal with our map.
Writing The Documentation took a week until 7Th of December, and writing the report in \textbf{\LaTeX} \space took another week up to 14Th of December, so We did it on time.

\section{Plans VS Actual}
\say{{\Large A goal without a plan is just a wish.\par}\say{Antoine de Saint-Exupéry}}
We started planning at earlier stage, that gave us the advantage of evaluation many solutions, and taking a look into some promising solutions, what we did over this project was not so far from what we have planned to do, but of course there is some points which we did planned to do it, but we couldn't due to time factor.
The graphical user interface, travelling methods, and giving more choices to the user like adding a place or rating it, we hope that we can improve that in the next release so the user has the ability to do more things.
